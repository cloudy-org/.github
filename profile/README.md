## ‚òÅÔ∏è What we do? *(or what will we do...)*
Our goal is to create open-source software made by the people and for the people with emphasis on configuration and choice. We build üêß Linux first but you'll find many of our applications with cross-platform support.

**Our philosophy is to keep things intuitive for the less experienced while maintaining the flexibility and customization for developers and advanced users.**

> For example let's say an image viewer was being developed and it had a button at the bottom right to access the gallery but that button was textured with a collage of images from the gallery (remember just an example). Now let's say for OPSEC reasons you do not want this button to leak images from your gallery, following the philosophy we believe in such moments a setting or configuration should exist to allow an advanced user to disable such a feature. Most GUI applications will not give you such power, that's the flexibility we are talking about.

Regardless we're just a group of dedicated devs who love developing ü¶Ö **FOSS**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Contributing
We're open to contributions, after all that's what makes open-source software the best. üí™

Although we have contribution and style guidelines we recommend you follow, otherwise your contribution could be discarded.

## *‚ùì Why did I create this organisation?*
So whenever I get irritated by shit software, I make an alternative here or I write shit for fun.
