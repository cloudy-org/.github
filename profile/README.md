## ‚òÅÔ∏è What we do? *(or what will we do...)*
Our goal is to create open-source software made by the people and for the people but with emphasis on the developer experience rather than speed and performance. Speed and performance is still our goal, just not our focus. Cross-platform is another goal although applications are mostly built üêß Linux first.

**Our philosophy is to keep things intuitive for the less experienced users while also maintaining the flexibility for developers and more experienced users.**

> For example let's say an image viewer was being developed and it had a button at the bottom right to access the gallery but that button was textured with a collage of images from the gallery (remember just an example). Now let's say for OPSEC reasons I do not want this button to leak my images from my gallery, following the philosophy we believe in such moments a setting or configuration should exist to allow an advanced user to disable such features. Most GUI applications will not give you such power, that's the flexibility we are talking about.

## üõ†Ô∏è Contributing
We're open to contributions, after all that's what makes open-source software the best. üí™

Although we have contribution and style guidelines we recommend you follow, otherwise your contribution could be discarded.
