## ‚òÅÔ∏è What we do? *(or what will we do...)*
Our goal is to create open-source software made by the people and for the people with emphasis on configuration and choice. We build üêß Linux first but you'll find many of our applications with cross-platform support.

**Our philosophy is to keep things intuitive for the less experienced while maintaining the flexibility for the developers and advanced users.**

> For example let's say an image viewer was being developed and it had a button at the bottom right to access the gallery but that button was textured with a collage of images from the gallery (remember just an example). Now let's say for OPSEC reasons I do not want this button to leak my images from my gallery, following the philosophy we believe in such moments a setting or configuration should exist to allow an advanced user to disable such features. Most GUI applications will not give you such power, that's the flexibility we are talking about.

## üõ†Ô∏è Contributing
We're open to contributions, after all that's what makes open-source software the best. üí™

Although we have contribution and style guidelines we recommend you follow, otherwise your contribution could be discarded.
