  # The ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloudy Philosophy

</div>

> [!WARNING]
> Cloudy-org is still establishing it's roots, this philosophy is not complete and may alter heavily.

> [!WARNING]
> Alpha, beta and experimental versions of software may risk breaking the philosophy.

At cloudy-org, software is developed to be free **as in** freedom, transparent, efficient (and performant) and to **do exactly what the software is designed to do**. Nothing more, nothing less.

The software created at cloudy-org is typically built to meet our own standards, needs and curiosity, and doing so by solving problems in our own creative way that we think is best; sometimes breaking software development boundaries. Each project begins as something we want to develop for ourselves, whether it's to learn, to explore, or to create an improved alternative; whatever it is, here at cloudy-org it stars with **enthusiasm**, **curiosity** and **passion.** üåü Then if it's something we want to pursue, it is slowly developed into a real application.

While the tools at cloudy-org are developed primarily to fit our vision, they are open-source and available for anyone to use, modify and [contribute to](./CONTRUBUTING.md).

If you don't like our software or vision, don't use it. If you find value in our software or you relate to our vision, use it and help us improve it. ü§ù

## üå± Our Principles
1. **Transparency via Documentation**

In addition to publicly available source code, we believe in software transparency via documentation. Not everyone is a software developer, so let's not treat everyone like one.

Each application will be thoroughly documented, all the way from it's basic usages to it's **exact** behaviours on your system and as far as **when** and **why** the software will perform activities such as making network requests. The documentation will give you a thorough overview, the source code will give you the exacts. After reading this, you'll know exactly what your application does and what every feature and configuration offers. You'll be the expert.

2. **Privacy by Default (OPT-IN)**

Your data is your data, keep it.

Our software is telemetry-free out of the box and will never include opt-out tracking by us.

3. **Efficiency and performance**

You don't need a NASA PC to run our applications, you won't need to worry about applications (such as electron based web apps) eating over a gigabyte of your RAM doing basic tasks from us.

We hate bloated, slow and inefficient software as much as you do. Our goal is to have our applications capable of running smooth on lower end / limited hardware abounded by these modern web applications that no longer care about your system resources.

Our applications will be lightweight and reasonably performant by avoiding unnecessary CPU usage, network activity, or any other wasteful processes. Our software will do **exactly what it's supposed to**, without overstepping many boundaries.

4. Customization like no other software.

> TODO: still work in progress

## ‚ùå Let's clear up what we DO NOT mean.

In principle **number 3** (efficiency and performance), when I mention "applications capable of running smooth on lower end hardware" and when I talk about modern day web applications no longer caring about your system resources, I DO NOT mean that we will not use these very web technologies to create web applications. I'm just mentioning it as an example here as realistically speaking we would weight the benefits and sustainability of a web application (such as a Tauri app) with the benefits and sustainability of a native application (such as a egui app) before we develop an application.
